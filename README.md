# 🌋 Volcanic Eruption Forecasting Results

This repository presents the key results and outputs from a **time-series deep learning model** designed to forecast volcanic eruptions using **synthetic monitoring data**. It includes an overview of the dataset, preprocessing steps, model training status, evaluation metrics, and sample predictions.

## 📄 Document Contents

### 1. 🧪 Synthetic Data Overview

This section includes the **head and tail** of the synthetic time-series dataset used for model training and testing. The simulated data includes the following volcanic monitoring parameters:

- Ground deformation
- Seismic activity
- Gas emissions
- Binary eruption indicator (`0` = no eruption, `1` = eruption)

---

### 2. ⚙️ Data Preprocessing Details

Describes how the data was structured for model input:

- **Shape of `X_sequences`**:  
  Format: `(samples, timesteps, features)`  
  Example: `(695, 30, 3)` = 695 sequences, each 30 days long, with 3 features per day.

- **Shape of `y_labels`**:  
  Corresponds to the binary label (eruption/no eruption) for each sequence.

- **Training/Testing Split**:  
  Specifies the number of samples used for training and testing the model.

---

### 3. 🏋️ Model Training Status

Summarizes the training timeline:

- Training start and end timestamps
- Confirmation of training completion

---

### 4. 📊 Model Evaluation on Test Data

Performance metrics of the trained model evaluated on unseen test data:

- **Test Loss**:  
  A numerical measure of the model's prediction error.

- **Test Accuracy**:  
  Percentage of correct predictions for eruption events.

### 5. 🔍 Sample Predictions vs. Actual (Test Set)

A table illustrating sample predictions:

| Predicted Label | Actual Label | Eruption Probability |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| 1               | 1            | 0.94                  |
| 0               | 0            | 0.07                  |
| 1               | 0            | 0.82                  |
| 0               | 1            | 0.41                  |

> Note: These are illustrative examples demonstrating output format.

## ⚠️ Note on Execution Environment

> The model training and evaluation processes were **simulated**. Actual TensorFlow-based execution was not run in this environment.  
> All reported metrics and outputs are **placeholders** for demonstration purposes.
